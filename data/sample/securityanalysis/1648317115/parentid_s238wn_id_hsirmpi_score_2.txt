Half the portfolio is Tesla. Go figure there 3 and 5 year returns are incredible. Only two investors. I wonder who. 

I feel like your impressive returns can’t be taken is process related and replicable if it’s all just because you happened to ride up the Tesla bubble. Congrats, but, what do you do next?
