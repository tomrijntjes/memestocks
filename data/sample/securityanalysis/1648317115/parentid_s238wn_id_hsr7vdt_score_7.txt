hi, neither the current P/E nor FCF multiple is great to use. Salesforce currently spends 45% of its revenue in marketing and sales, and hence both earnings and FCF (after deducting stock comps) are low. However they spend this much in marketing to grow 20% p.a, as you point out. 

Like you said you understand they can grow 20%, if so then their revenue will be $60bn in the next 5 years (slightly above what they guided in their investor presentation). 

By then, they can decide to cut back on marketing and sales if there are no further opportunities to deploy marketing spending. Assuming marketing and sales will then be 20-25% of their revenue then, and G&A as % of revenue continues to trend down, then their profit margin will be 25%-30%, from the current non-existent margin. That will be a profit of $17bn. Applying a 25x multiple to this and you have a $425bn market cap company in 5 year, roughly a double from the current market cap. 

However if they still think there are opportunities to grow then they will keep spending majority of their earnings/fcf in marketing. And the cycle continues until there are no further opportunities, by then they will cut marketing and sales and enjoy a fat margin.
