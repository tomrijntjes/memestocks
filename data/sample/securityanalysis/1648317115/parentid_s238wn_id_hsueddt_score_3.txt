PE is irrelevant. Imagine a growth company that only recently just started making positive profits. It has one cent in profit, but fast growing revenue and increasing margins. That company could have a 1000 PE, it doesn’t mean anything which is why people are telling you PE isn’t a meaningful metric for growth companies.
